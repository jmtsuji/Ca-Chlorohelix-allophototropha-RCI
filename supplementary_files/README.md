This folder contains supplementary data files referenced in the manuscript text that could be particularly helpful to understand the analyses performed:
- `Data_01_ASV_table.xlsx` - results of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the enrichment cultures presented in this study
- `Data_02_RCI_gene_context.xlsx` - Gene context of the the novel _pscA_-like genes detected among '_Ca_. Chloroheliales' members. BLASTP results are shown of the predicted primary sequences of 20 genes up/downstream of the novel _pscA_-like genes.
- `Data_03_bidirectional_BLASTP_results.xlsx` - Raw results of the data presented in Fig. 3 in the manuscript.

In addition:
- Custom profile hidden Markov models and homology models (mentioned in the manuscript) can be found under the `genome_bin_analysis` folder in this repo. 
- The full output of I-TASSER for homology modelling (for those who really want to dive deep into the data) is available at the [Zenodo data repository corresponding to this code repo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3930110).
- ATLAS config files containing the settings used for metagenome analysis are available under `metagenome_analysis/atlas_Chx_allophototropha` and `metagenome_analysis/atlas_L227_5C`
