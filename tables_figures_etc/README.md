This folder contains raw-ish data files for the figures, tables, and extended data files presented in the manuscript.

See a description of each of these data presentations in the manuscript text.

Note that some of the figures with phylogenies include gradient fill objects that don't display well in some PDF viewers. You might need to export those figures to an image file (e.g., PNG) using a vector editor (like Inkscape) if you can't get them to display properly as PDF.

Enjoy!
