This folder contains summary files referenced in the manuscript text that could be particularly helpful to understand the analyses performed:
- `ASV_table.xlsx` - results of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the enrichment cultures presented in this study
- `RCI_gene_context.xlsx` - Gene context of the the novel _pscA_-like genes detected among '_Ca_. Chloroheliales' members. BLASTP results are shown of the predicted primary sequences of 20 genes up/downstream of the novel _pscA_-like genes.
- `bidirectional_BLASTP_results.xlsx` - Raw results of the data presented in Fig. 3 in the manuscript.

In addition, custom profile hidden Markov models and homology models are mentioned in the manuscript. Raw model files can be found under the `genome_bin_analysis` folder in this repo. The full output of I-TASSER for homology modelling (for those who really want to dive deep into the data) are available at the [Zenodo data repository corresponding to this code repo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3930110).
